# regexplain

Don't you hate it when you have to type in your phone number, postcode or ID number on a website, and it shows an error saying "Invalid input"?

Your users will hate that too... unless you explain whatever regular expression is validating that input, in plain language.

Now you can, in python, using regexplain.

It's a compiler that compiles a regular expression to run on a certain wet CPU known as a human brain.

Of course these CPUs have their own instruction sets known as natural languages, which it compiles for.
